# Gulp boilerplate
A front-end boilerplate using Gulp as build tool.

## How to run
Install Gulp globally (if you don't already have it). Full installation docs (https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start).
    `npm install gulp-cli -g`

Install necessary packages
    `npm install`

Run Gulp
    `gulp`

The live reload task should then initiate the project on http://localhost:3000. 
If that port is already taken it will default to another number such as localhost:3001.

## Building assets
To build assets without starting a local server with live reload, use the build command:
    `gulp build`
